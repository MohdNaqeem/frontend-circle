=> There are three syntax of binding 
   Interpolation
   Property binding
   Event binding

=> What is interpolation and binding.
   In AngularJS, Interpolation is a way to transfer the data from a TypeScript code to an HTML template 
   (view), i.e. it is a method by which we can put an expression in between some text and get the value 
   of that expression. Interpolation basically binds the text with the expression value. 
   interpolation just work in the case of number, numeric value and string it doesn't work in the 
   case of boolean.
   Syntax : propertyName={{VariableandFuntionName}} , {{VariableandFuntionName}}

=> What is property binding
   Property binding in Angular helps you set values for properties of HTML elements or directives. Use 
   property binding to do things such as toggle button features, set paths programmatically, and share 
   values between components.
   where we have to change the value of data and disabled then in this case we have to use property binding
   Sntax : [propertyName]=VariableandFunctionName

=> What is event binding
   Event binding lets you listen for and respond to user actions such as keystrokes, mouse movements, 
   clicks, and touches. See the live example / download example for a working example containing the code 
   snippets in this guide.

=> What is directives.
   In Angular, Directives are defined as classes that can add new behavior to the elements in the 
   template or modify existing behavior. The purpose of Directives in Angular is to maneuver the DOM, be 
   it by adding new elements to DOM or removing elements and even changing the appearance of the DOM 
   elements. there are two types structural and attribute directives.
